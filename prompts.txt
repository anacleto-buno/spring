 Create an API endpoint (e.g., POST /products/generate) that, when called, generates at least 1000 "product" records and stores them in the chosen database. The product properties remain the same: name, description, category, brand, price, stock quantity, SKU, release date, availability status, customer rating, available colors and sizes. This endpoint could optionally take parameters for the number of products to generate or specific seed data.

Initial Data Load: The frontend application will call the GET /products on initial load to display the first set of products.
Search Input: Provide a single input field (a text box) where the user can type their search query.
Dynamic filtering with aPI calls: As the user types, the frontend should make API calls to the GET /products/search endpoint.
Display result: Display the filtered list of products in a clear and readable format.
Performance and Responsiveness: The filtering process should feel fast and smooth, even with 1000+ items and multiple characters typed.
